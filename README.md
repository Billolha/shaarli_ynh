Shaarli for Yunohost
v0.0.41beta, based on sebsauvage's project.

This project is outdated (a community version took over Shaarli developement), but still working correctly with Yunohost.
Tested on Yunohost v2.4 (should work on 2.2).

To update using this version, use the following address: `https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/shaarli_ynh/tree/v0.0.41beta`
(Example in CLI: `yunohost app upgrade shaarli -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/shaarli_ynh/tree/v0.0.41beta`)

Thanks to @julienmalik for creating this app.
